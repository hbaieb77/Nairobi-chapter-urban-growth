## City Growth Models
### City Growth Models – Data Collection

#### How the work is split up: 
We have identified the 20 largest cities in Africa and assigned different cities to different members of the City Growth Models Team. 
See your assigned cities on the City Growth Models Work Assignment – You have been assigned to any city that has your name as Owner 1 or Owner 2. 

#### What I am looking for? 
The below section details the type of data you should find for the cities you have been assigned to: 

#### Essential Variables:
Primarily look for data that includes the below variables (these are the Target variables for the 3 city growth models):  
- Population
- House demand (number of houses)
- Land use (measured as an area)

#### Time Period of Data:
- For the land use and housing demand models, we will get multiple years of data for each city, including the most recent data available. 
- For the population growth model, we will try and get historical data from the last 20 years 2003 – 2023 (but more years is good and should be included if available).  

#### Other variables: 
You should also look for the below variables that can be linked to each city and may be useful predictors for the Target variables: 
- Country gdp 
- Country gdp per capita
- Country Population
- Country Net Migration
- Country Population Density (people per km squared)
- City average people per household
- City population density (people per square meter)
- Country Growth Trends (some measure of how fast a countries population is growing now)
- Country GDP Trends (measure of speed of gdp growth)
- City Growth Rate (some measure of how fast a cities population is growing now)
- Country Age Demographics
- Country or City Urbanization Rate

#### What if my data has information on multiple cities or countries? 
You should save the entire dataset and clearly record in the tracker what cities / countries the dataset applies to.
